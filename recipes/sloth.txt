Directions:
4. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.
6. Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl. Divide each half into 12 parts.
7. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square. Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes.
8. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.
9. Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok.
10. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns. At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.
